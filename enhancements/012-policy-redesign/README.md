# Design Package: Rethinking `#Policy` for Cross-Component Concerns

## Summary

`#Module` composes one or more `#Component`. Components carry `#Resource` and `#Trait` — authoring-local facts. OPM today has no crisp home for concerns that span a set of components or the module as a whole. `#Policy` was introduced for this slot, broadened in 011 to carry `#PolicyRule` + `#Directive`. That broadening covers one flavor (operational commodities via `#Directive`) and leaves the cross-component "noun" flavor — shared networks, shared storage pools, shared identities — unmodeled.

This enhancement is an exploration, not a landed design. It catches up the record of a brainstorm comparing several ways to model cross-component concerns, records the KubeVela prior-art research that motivated the question, and lists open questions for the next round.

## Scope

### In scope

- Problem framing: three grammars of cross-component concern (noun, verb, constraint).
- Comparison of candidate models for expressing those grammars in OPM.
- Prior-art research: why KubeVela dropped `ApplicationScope` in favor of `Policy`, and what was lost.
- Open questions that gate convergence on one model.

### Out of scope

- A chosen design. 012 is divergent-phase; the next document in this line is expected to pick one approach and flesh it out.
- Detailed transformer-scope schema changes beyond illustration.
- Migration plan for existing `#PolicyRule` / `#Directive` usage.
